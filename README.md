Manifest
--------

This archive contains the following files:

* `README.md` - this file
* `GPL` - a copy of the GNU General Public License version 2
* `pymbar/` - Python MBAR package
* `examples/` - examples of applications of MBAR to various types of experiments

Prerequisites
-------------

The pymbar module requires the following:

* Python 2.4 or later: http://www.python.org/
* the NumPy package: http://numpy.scipy.org/
* the SciPy package: http://www.scipy.org/
* Some optional graphing functionality in the tests requires the matplotlib library: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

Many of these packages are now standard in scientific Python installations or bundles, such as [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) or [continuum.io Anaconda](http://continuum.io/).

Installation
------------

There are several ways to install pymbar.

You can grab the latest version from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymbar) with `easy_install`:
```tcsh
easy_install pymbar
```
or using `pip install`:
```tcsh
pip install pymbar
```

Or, if you download the [GitHub version](http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar), you can use the provided `setup.py` to install.

To install to your default Python site-packages location:
```tcsh
# python setup.py install
```
Or to install to a different location (e.g. a local Python package repository):
```tcsh
# python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/my/site-packages/
```
The C++ helper code will automatically be built in both cases, if possible.

To build pymbar in situ, without installing to site-packages, run
```tcsh
# python setup.py build
```
and add the directory containing this file to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
```tcsh
# For tcsh
setenv PYTHONPATH "/path/to/pymbar:$PYTHONPATH"
# For bash
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/pymbar:$PYTHONPTH"
```

Usage
-----

In Python 2.4 or later, you can view the docstrings with `help()`:
```python
>>> from pymbar import MBAR
>>> help(MBAR)
```
See the example code in the docstrings, or find more elaborate examples in the `examples/` directory.

Basic usage involves first constructing a MBAR object, initializing it with the reduced potential from the simulation or experimental data:
```python
>>> mbar = MBAR(u_kln, N_k)
```
Next, we extract the dimensionless free energy differences and uncertainties:
```python
>>> (Deltaf_ij_estimated, dDeltaf_ij_estimated) = mbar.getFreeEnergyDifferences()
```
or compute expectations of given observables A(x) for all states:
```python
>>> (A_k_estimated, dA_k_estimated) = mbar.computeExpectations(A_kn)
```
See the help for these individual methods for more information on exact usage.

Examples
--------

Several examples of applications of `pymbar` to various types of simulation data can be found in [pymbar-examples](http://github.com/choderalab/pymbar-examples/).

Optimizations and improvements
------------------------------

By default, the pymbar class uses an adaptive method which uses self-consistent iteration initially and switches to Newton-Raphson iteration (with N-R implemented as described in the Appendix of Ref. [1]) when the norm of the gradient of a Newton-Raphson step is lower than the norm of the gradient of a self-consistent step. Self-consistent iteration or Newton-Raphson can be selected instead if desired.  For example, to use the Newton-Raphson solver alone, add the optional argument:
```python
method = 'Newton-Raphson'
```
to the MBAR initialization, as in 
```python
>>> mbar = MBAR.MBAR(u_kln, N_k, method = 'Newton-Raphson')
```
In very rare cases, the self-consistent iteration may still work when the adaptive method switches to Newton-Raphson prematurely.

* C++ helper code

We have provided a C++ helper code (`_pymbar.c`) to speed up the most time-consuming operation in computing the dimensionless free energies (used by all methods).  For many applications, use of the compiled helper code results in a speedup of ~40x.  There should be no significant difference in the output (if any) between the pure-Python/Numpy results and those employing the helper routine.  

The routine should be installed correctly using the `setup.py` script, but if it fails, instructions on compilation for several platforms can be found in the header of `_pymbar.c`.

pymbar.py will import and use the compiled dynamic library (`_pymbar.so`) provided it can be found in your `PYTHONPATH`.  An optional `use_optimized` flag passed to the MBAR constructor can be used to force or disable this behavior.  Passing the flag `use_optimized = False` to the MBAR initialization will disable use of the module.
```python
>>> mbar = pymbar.MBAR(u_kln, N_k, use_optimized = False)
```
