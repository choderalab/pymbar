Hi John,

Here are 5s records, with data points every 0.1 ms, recorded at 16
different forces for the same molecule, hairpin 20R55/4T in the naming
scheme I used in the paper. It's the same hairpin as for Fig. 1. I stuck
the data in an Excel file.

As far as errors go, there are some reasonably large systematic errors
that can crop up in the force, so the absolute force values are known to
within about 10% or so for a given molecule (bead size variations are a
large factor here). As a first pass, by all means feel free to ignore
the errors, but it's a good idea to keep them in mind for further down
the road. Definitely, the file does not quote significant digits
properly!!

I have three more datasets that are ready to be sent, and several more
to sort through. Hopefully this will give you something to work with for
now...

Cheers,

--Michael
