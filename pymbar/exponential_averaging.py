# * Fix computeBAR and computeEXP to be BAR() and EXP() to make them easier to find.
# * Make functions that don't need to be exported (like logsum) private by prefixing an underscore.
# * Make asymptotic covariance matrix computation more robust to over/underflow.
# * Double-check correspondence of comments to equation numbers once manuscript has been finalized.
# * Change self.nonzero_N_k_indices to self.states_with_samples

  Estimate free energy difference using one-sided (unidirectional) exponential averaging (EXP).

  ARGUMENTS
    w_F (numpy array) - w_F[t] is the forward work value from snapshot t.  t = 0...(T-1)  Length T is deduced from vector.

  OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
    compute_uncertainty (boolean) - if False, will disable computation of the statistical uncertainty (default: True)
    is_timeseries (boolean) - if True, correlation in data is corrected for by estimation of statisitcal inefficiency (default: False)
                              Use this option if you are providing correlated timeseries data and have not subsampled the data to produce uncorrelated samples.

  RETURNS
    DeltaF (float) - DeltaF is the free energy difference between the two states.
    dDeltaF (float) - dDeltaF is the uncertainty, and is only returned if compute_uncertainty is set to True

  NOTE

    If you are prodividing correlated timeseries data, be sure to set the 'timeseries' flag to True

  EXAMPLES

  Compute the free energy difference given a sample of forward work values.
