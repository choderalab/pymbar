A module for extracting uncorrelated samples from correlated timeseries data.

This module provides various tools that allow one to examine the correlation functions and
integrated autocorrelation times in correlated timeseries data, compute statistical inefficiencies,
and automatically extract uncorrelated samples for data analysis.

def statistical_inefficiency(A_n, B_n=None, fast=False, mintime=3, fft=False):
    """Compute the (cross) statistical inefficiency of (two) timeseries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A_n : np.ndarray, float
        A_n[n] is nth value of timeseries A.  Length is deduced from vector.
    B_n : np.ndarray, float, optional, default=None
        B_n[n] is nth value of timeseries B.  Length is deduced from vector.
        If supplied, the cross-correlation of timeseries A and B will be estimated instead of the
        autocorrelation of timeseries A.
    fast : bool, optional, default=False
        f True, will use faster (but less accurate) method to estimate correlation
        time, described in Ref. [1] (default: False).  This is ignored
        when B_n=None and fft=True.
    mintime : int, optional, default=3
        minimum amount of correlation function to compute (default: 3)
        The algorithm terminates after computing the correlation time out to mintime when the
        correlation function first goes negative.  Note that this time may need to be increased
        if there is a strong initial negative peak in the correlation function.
    fft : bool, optional, default=False
        If fft=True and B_n=None, then use the fft based approach, as
        implemented in statistical_inefficiency_fft().

    Returns
    -------
    g : np.ndarray,
        g is the estimated statistical inefficiency (equal to 1 + 2 tau, where tau is the correlation time).
        We enforce g >= 1.0.

    Notes
    -----
    The same timeseries can be used for both A_n and B_n to get the autocorrelation statistical inefficiency.
    The fast method described in Ref [1] is used to compute g.

def subsample_correlated_data(A_t, g=None, fast=False, conservative=False, verbose=False):
    """Determine the indices of an uncorrelated subsample of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A_t : np.ndarray
        A_t[t] is the t-th value of timeseries A(t).  Length is deduced from vector.
    g : float, optional
        if provided, the statistical inefficiency g is used to subsample the timeseries -- otherwise it will be computed (default: None)
    fast : bool, optional, default=False
        fast can be set to True to give a less accurate but very quick estimate (default: False)
    conservative : bool, optional, default=False
        if set to True, uniformly-spaced indices are chosen with interval ceil(g), where
        g is the statistical inefficiency.  Otherwise, indices are chosen non-uniformly with interval of
        approximately g in order to end up with approximately T/g total indices
    verbose : bool, optional, default=False
        if True, some output is printed

    Returns
    -------
    indices : list of int
        the indices of an uncorrelated subsample of the data

    Notes
    -----
    The statistical inefficiency is computed with the function computeStatisticalInefficiency().

    ToDo
    ----
    Instead of using regular stride, use irregular stride so more data can be fit in when g is non-integral.

    --------
